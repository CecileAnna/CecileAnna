### Hi ðŸ‘‹
Throughout my studies and worklife Iâ€™ve focused on creativity and telling stories. I am internationally minded and have a Danish/Swiss dual citizenship. I'm passionate about evolving my skills in innovative digital media solutions!
I'm currently studying Frontend Development focusing on React. Going forward I want to specialize in UX design!
